Hi there,

Thank you all for getting those topics together for DES 3130 and 4130.

I just approved the c-forms, but in doing so I noticed a discrepancy that exists among a lot of the DES courses. I made the correction on DES 3130 and 4130 but you may need to go through all the rest of the DES courses (except DES 3100, 3001, 5100 and 5115) to correct that they should all say "two hours of lecture and three hours of activity". Many of them say "two hours of activity". The courses have all been scheduled for 5 hours total per week so that is not an issue. It's more just truth in advertising ðŸ˜„.

It is past our deadline for submitting these to be effective for next AY, but could you please put this on your to-do list so they will eventually be corrected?

Thanks!
Kathy
