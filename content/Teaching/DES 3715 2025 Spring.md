	- Blind and low-vision people have experienced remarkable gains in information literacy because of digital technologies, like being able to access an online library offering more than 1.2 million books that can be translated into text-to-speech or digital Braille. But it can be a lot harder to come by an accessible map of a neighborhood they want to visit, or any simple diagram, due to limited availability of tactile graphics equipment, design inaccessibility, and publishing practices. 
	- Chancey Fleet wants a technological future that’s more organically attuned to people’s needs, which requires including people with disabilities in every step of the development and deployment process. She speaks with EFF’s Cindy Cohn and Jason Kelley about building an internet that’s just and useful for all, and why this must include giving blind and low-vision people the discretion to decide when and how to engage artificial intelligence tools to solve accessibility problems and surmount barriers.

When the number of options is overwhelming, it can easily lead to analysis paralysis — a situation when the user is unable to make a decision."

## Concepts
### Juice
Juice: [https://garden.bradwoods.io/notes/design/juice](https://garden.bradwoods.io/notes/design/juice)

Juice is the non-essential visual, audio, and haptic effects that enhance the player's experience. For example, the delightful chimes that play when Mario collects a mushroom. The 1UP text that appears is essential. The chimes communicate the player gained an extra life. The sound is the Juice. Nonessential but serves a purpose:

▪reinforcing Mario did indeed collect the mushroom, 
▪that this was a good thing, by using a delightful sound, and 
▪giving the player a small reward. Encouraging them to collect more and teaching them how to play.

### Accessibilty 
- https://productsofdesign.sva.edu/projects/2023/veu-zai-thakoor
	- Her speculative concept, Veu, initially took the form of an app and photo filter that showed those with full-color vision what the world looks like to those without. However, as Thakoor continued to explore various audiences and use cases, she eventually narrowed Veu’s users to those with color vision deficiencies rather than those without.
